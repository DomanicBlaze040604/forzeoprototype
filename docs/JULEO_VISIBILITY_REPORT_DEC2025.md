**Groq Response (excerpt):**

## Key Findings

### 1. Juleo's AI Visibility is LOW
- **Only 33% of tests** showed strong Juleo presence (3+ mentions)
- **44% of tests** showed ZERO Juleo mentions
- Juleo is only found when:
  - Explicitly named in the query (tests 7, 8, 9)
  - Searching for branded term "Trusted Singles Club" (test 5)

### 2. Competitor Dominance
| Competitor | Total Mentions Across Tests |

| Bumble | 27 |
| Tinder | 15 |
| Shaadi | 20 |
| Jeevansathi | 14 |
| OkCupid | 6 |
| Aisle | 2 |

### 3. Feature Visibility Gaps
| Juleo Feature | AI Awareness |
|---------------|--------------|
| Government ID Verification | ⚠️ Partial (only in branded searches) |
| DigiLocker Integration | ✅ Known (in direct queries) |
| Video KYC | ✅ Known (in direct queries) |
| Trusted Singles Club | ✅ Owned |
| Personal Matchmaking Genie | ❌ Unknown |
| No-Swipe Model | ❌ Unknown |

### 4. DataForSEO vs Groq Comparison
| Source | Juleo Knowledge |
|--------|-----------------|
| DataForSEO (Google SERP) | ✅ Has indexed Juleo content |
| Groq (Llama 3.1 AI) | ❌ "Couldn't find information about Juleo" |

**Critical Insight:** Google has indexed Juleo content, but general AI models (like Llama) have NO training data about Juleo. This means AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) likely don't know about Juleo either.
